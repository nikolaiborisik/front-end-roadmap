## Introduction

List of questions, resources, and exercises to help developer skill up in the specific topic step by step.

### 🚀 Goals

- Organising learning courses inside the company
- Reuse third party materials as much as possible
- Having mentors in each topic
- No lectures
- Individual learning with a mentor without strict course time
- Dividing each topic by level
- To Complete level doesn't require much time
- Anyone is welcome to contribute and be a mentor
- Do Learn Share

The _topic_ can be a specific framework, library, language, etc. Topics example: TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Angular, RxJs, Redux, MobX, etc.

> Topic levels don't have a close connection with developer levels like junior, middle and senior. It just shows developer knowledge and skill in the specific topic.

### Topic requirements:

- Topic has 3 levels maximum
- Topic divide into portion questions
- Questions are limited by 1-2 page information
- Each question has links to the specific section in the topic resources that fully covers the question for this level.
- Externals resources used as documentation and exercise.
- Each level ideally takes to achieve less than 20 hours on average
- Each topic has exercises and tasks.

### Levels

- _Fundamentals_ level - knowledge of this level should be enough to solve standard daily tasks.
- _Intermediate_ level - knowledge of this level should allow effectively solving most of the tasks
- _Advance level_ - deep dive into the technology, more theoretical

> Fundamentals and Intermediate levels have the highest priority
